CLASS -> PANELSESSION
property -> Operations (either a linkedlist or a heap of operation objects that stores the operations that have been performed) 
property -> image path to the currently rendered panel of the manga
method -> perform Operation (this takes an operation name and performs the given operation to the image and adds its to the list)
method -> render side-by-side (this method spawns an openCV window independent of the main view with the last 4 operations concatted together from left to right)

CLASS -> OPERATION <Abstract>
A data class that has a name off the operation
and a dictionary with arg names and values
a method -> apply that takes an input image and returns the image after applying the operation

OPERATION CLASSES [Threshold, Rotate, Open, Close] (for now)  

CLASS -> VIEW
property -> PanelSession
method -> render() this renders the current place we are in the linked list
keyboard listener?
observer pattern for knowing when to rerender (traversing operations or applying them) 
View is a UI element that has the currently selected panel with under that a drop down with available operations
depending on the selection operation the input fields under the dropdown are generated dynamically and contain the hyper parameters for each operation 

use Tkinter or pyQt for cross platform support



+ applies the currently selected operation to the current point of the linked list
- removes the currently viewed operation from the linked list

up arrow key goes up the linked list
down arrow key goes down the linked list
left arrow key goes to the previous manga panel
right arrow key goes to the next manga panel
r resets the panel session

cache and recompute
the beauty is we can recompute from intermediary images. 

NonOperation that does nothing to be the tail of the LinkedList upon creation
Once we hit the max Operations we release the current tail and rebind it
