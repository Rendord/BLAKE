using AI image pipelines to visualize details

today I learned about the concept of probing:
sliding a 3x3 grid over every pixel in an image
and performing operations on a pixel based on it's neighbours
this will be invaluable when processing panels later on

Frame extraction -> what we want to do later is dissecting a panel into it's individual frames
An individual frame can be examined as a camera shot from a single point, so this shot adheres to a single perspective
Therefore the order becomes -> Dissect into frames -> turn into SVGs -> extract Geometry
We can use even more computer vision to recognize elements as either background or foreground, this way we can remove characters and visual effects
After that we can try to reconstruct the geometry that those elements were overlaying
